## Challenges and Learnings

- **API Integration:** Handling API errors and managing rate limits with the Spoonacular API taught me the importance of robust error handling and fallback mechanisms (e.g., using mock data).
- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the app works seamlessly across devices required careful use of Tailwind CSS’s responsive utilities and testing on multiple screen sizes.
- **State Management:** Using React Hooks to manage state and side effects improved my understanding of React’s functional components.
- **User Experience:** Implementing smooth animations with Framer Motion and a mobile-friendly navigation menu enhanced the app’s interactivity.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication to allow registered users to save favorite recipes and post to the community.
- Implement a search feature to filter recipes by ingredients or dietary preferences.
- Integrate a backend (e.g., Firebase or Node.js) to store and manage community posts.
- Enhance accessibility by adding ARIA labels and improving keyboard navigation.
